# hello-world
This is for greeting the world and learning github basics
I'm Joshua Potts and I currently work at Trion Worlds as a Quality Assurance Tester. I'm working on learning Python in my free time and on documenting/commenting our Python automations to learn more and ideally move into a QA Automation Engineer role. Github seems like a necessary and marketable skill, so here I am learning it as well.
